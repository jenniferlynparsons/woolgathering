# Woolgathering

Welcome to my digital garden. This is a place for me to gather both complete and incomplete thoughts on any topic that catches my interest. There will likely be a lot of software development notes, but my interests are fairly wide ranging.

You can tell how complete the note is by checking out the season. Notes "start" in autumn as I go inner and develop ideas. We "end" in summer, when things reach the height of their fruition.

## About the site

This repo contains the notes I organize with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and publish with the [notenote](https://notenote.link/) Jekyll theme via Github and Netlify.
