There is a subset of RPGs that I'm drawn to, though I haven't played. 

-  [A Mending](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shing/a-mending): A solo keepsake game about a journey to visit a dear and distant friend, using sewing, map-annotating, and story-building mechanics.
-  [For the Queen](https://www.evilhat.com/home/for-the-queen/): _For the Queen_ is a card-based story-building game that you and up to five other players can begin playing in minutes.
-  [Dialect](https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect): Dialect is a game about an isolated community, their language, and what it means for that language to be lost.
-  [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year): The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a community living after the collapse of civilization, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year.
