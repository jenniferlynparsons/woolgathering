Welcome to my digital garden. This is a place for me to gather both complete and incomplete thoughts on any topic that catches my interest. There will likely be a lot of software development notes, but my interests are fairly wide ranging.

You can tell how complete the note is by checking out the season. Notes "start" in autumn as I go inner and develop ideas. We "end" in summer, when things reach the height of their fruition.

## About me

paladin. coder. writer. pagan. queer. autistic. crone. comic geek. tea snob. vegetarian.

I’m a kid from New Jersey, a life-long lover of books. I still build blanket forts. I’ve flown a glider and played Carnegie Hall. I taught myself how to write code and then found people who helped me get even better at it. Now I get to do it for a living. Before I figured that out, I was unemployed for a bit and created a literary journal magazine thing. And before that, I used to design websites and manage a production team on a newspaper with 17 weekly editions. Along the way, I decided to write books and teach myself to knit and crochet. The comics and tea and video games get squeezed in there somewhere. My grandmother would be proud of me. I’m never bored.

## Where to find me
